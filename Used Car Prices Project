","Here are the questons I hope to answer:","","* Which car brand generally holds the most value over a wide mileage spread?","* Which car brand generally holds the most value when the car hits 100k miles?","* Which car brand does not hold their value well at 100k+ miles?","","## Dataset","The used-car-price-prediction-dataset.csv file was accessed through a public data set on Kaggle. It pulled data about used cars from popular website \"www.cars.com\". This is sample data, thuss it does not represent every car listing on the website for each brand. For this analysis we are mainly interested in mileage and price columns.","","### Data Description","* brand - (maker of vehicle)","* model - (model of vehicle)","* model_year - (year manufactured)","* milage - (how many miles it has travelled)","* fuel_type - (what fuel type powers the car?)","* engine - (Lots of different data about engine types here)","* transmission - (Lots of different data about transmission types here)","* ext_col - (external color)","* int_col - (internal color)","* accident - (\"no accidents\" or \"one or more accidents reported\")","* clean title - (yes/no)","* price - (price listing of the vehicle)","","## Data Preparation","Describe the steps you took to prepare the data for analysis.
